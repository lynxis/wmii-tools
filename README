This is a set of statusbar programs for use with wmii.

They use libixp to communicate with wmii.

There is an upower-based battery monitor and a clock
that also includes a cpu and memory monitor.

Being not more than a personal hack you can expect to
have to configure stuff in the source.

Note the GPLv2 license in COPYING.
